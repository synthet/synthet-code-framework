# Canonical sources

Agents and contributors must check this map before inventing API paths, schema names, config keys, or
status values. Fill in the right column as your project grows; the left column is the reusable
question.

| Contract / convention | Source of truth (fill in) |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Public API shape | `<path to API contract / OpenAPI>` |
| Data model / schema | `<path to schema / migrations>` |
| Config keys | `<path to config module / schema>` |
| Status / state enums | `<path to the enum definition>` |
| Domain vocabulary | `<path to a terminology doc>` |
| Build / test / lint commands | [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) |
| Optional file-search MCP (fff) | [fff repo](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/fff); template keys `fff-mcp` / `${MCP_PREFIX}-fff` in [`.cursor/mcp.example.json`](../.cursor/mcp.example.json) |
| CLI tooling skills spec | [`.agent/cli-tools-skills-spec.md`](../.agent/cli-tools-skills-spec.md) |
| Agent assets (rules/commands/skills/agents) | [`ai-workflow/README.md`](ai-workflow/README.md) |
| Safety rules | [`../.agent/SAFETY.md`](../.agent/SAFETY.md) |
| Wiki conventions | [`WIKI_SCHEMA.md`](WIKI_SCHEMA.md) |

**Rule:** code and the written contract must never disagree. If you change one, change the other in
the same PR (see [`../.agent/workflows/cross_repo_contract_change.md`](../.agent/workflows/cross_repo_contract_change.md)).
